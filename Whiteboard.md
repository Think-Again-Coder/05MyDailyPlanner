# Work Day Scheduler

## Main function Outline:
    1. User pulls up page with current date
    2. User can select a timeblock from 9am to 5pm for a schedule event. 
    3. User will see color coded 1 hour time slots that represent past, present, and future.
    4. User can input text directly to page's timeblock.
    5. User will hit save button to store entry into local storage for recall. 
    6. After hitting the refresh button, my events will remain.


## Coding Logic Outline: 

1. Use moment api to show current time and date in Header. Link to the individual time coded functions below.
2. Create x9 class timeblock elements(bootstrap?) that can be updated in real time and stored in local storage.
3. Use a function to link the saved button to all timeblocks. 
4. Use a function to color code all the time slots for past. Use the existing css selectors.  
5. Use function to color code the timeblock for present. Use css selectors already designated for present time. 
6. Use function to color code for future time. Use css selectors designated for the future timeblock.
